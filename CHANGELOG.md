## 2016-10-24, Version 1.0.3
- Fix issue in [Consumer Group](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node#consumergroup) where using the migrator with no previous HLC offsets will set initial offsets to 0 instead of the offsets provided in "fromOfset" feature [#493](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/493)

## 2016-10-22, Version 1.0.2
- Fix issue in [Consumer Group](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node#consumergroup) where using the migrator with no previous HLC offsets will set initial offsets to -1 [#490](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/490)

## 2016-10-13, Version 1.0.1

- Fix missing support in [Consumer Group](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node#consumergroup) for fromOffset using `earliest` and `none` [#483](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/483)

## 2016-10-10, Version 1.0.0

Major version change since we're dropping support for Node older than v4.

* Add group membership API protocols 
* Add consumerGroup roundrobin assignment
* Add documentation for ConsumerGroup
* Implemented range assignment strategy
* New consumer group should still emit rebalanced and rebalancing events
* Refactor HLC rebalancing test to run against ConsumerGroup as well
* Add migration from existing HLC offsets in ConsumerGroups
* Implement rolling migration of HLC offsets for consumer groups
* Dropping support for node 0.12 and only supporting 4 and above. Updating to version 1.0.0
* Upgrade mocha
* Migrator: cover the cases of slow rebalances by adding verification by checking check four times make sure the zookeeper ownership did not come back

## 2016-08-05, Version 0.5.3
- Fix for some long standing high-level consumer rebalance issues: [#423](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/423)
	- Fixed issue where consumers who weren't assigned a partition would never rebalance... ever
	- Fixed issue where calling `close` consumer did not force the consumer to leave the consumer group and so locks the partition(s) for (the default) of 30000ms
	- Fixed issue where consumers who weren't assigned a partition never emitted a `rebalance` event after rebalancing
	- Additional cases to be addressed in the next release:
		- If consumer joins or leaves a group during another consumers rebalance then that rebalancing consumer may miss owning partitions
		- Changes to a topic's partition does not trigger a rebalance
