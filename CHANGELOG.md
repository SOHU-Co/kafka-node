## 2017-01-12, Version 1.2.1

- Fix potential issue where long running consumers (includes ConsumerGroup, HighLevelConsumer, and Consumer) could throw out of bounds exception during the fetch loop [#556](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/556)

## 2017-01-11, Version 1.2.0

**Consumer Group Changes**

- Fix issue where an error in a leaving group during close will prevent a consumer from being closed. [#551](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/551)
- Fix issue with heartbeat where consumer will continue to send heartbeats at regular intervals even when previous ones did not resolve [#547](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/547)
- Add ability for ConsumerGroup to recover from stale offsets. This is configured by the new `outOfRangeOffset` option which takes same values as `fromOffset`. [#553](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/553)

## 2017-01-04, Version 1.1.0

- Fixed issue with unhandled error while using Offset [#543](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/543)
- HighLevelConsumer now allows a configurable retry options used for rebalancing this is found under the `rebalanceRetry` option key [#542](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/542)
- Fixed issue in HighLevelConsumer where an offset of 0 for new topics was not committed [#529](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/529)
- Upgraded `nested-error-stacks` dependency for node 7 compatibility [#540](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/540)

## 2016-11-18, Version 1.0.7
- Fix issue where `createTopics` using the `async` set to `false` was not synchronous. [#519](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/519)

   **NOTE**: The behavior now is if `async` is true the callback is not actually called until all the topics are confirmed to have been created by Kafka. The previous behavior the callback would be called after the first request (which does not guarantee the topics have been created). This wasn't consistent with what the doc said. 

- Fix issue where messages are lost when sending a batch of keyed messages using the highLevelPartitioner [#521](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/521)

- Fix issue where invalid characters could be used in createTopics call [#495](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/495) [#492](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/492)

## 2016-10-24, Version 1.0.3
- Fix issue in [Consumer Group](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node#consumergroup) where using the migrator with no previous HLC offsets will set initial offsets to 0 instead of the offsets provided in "fromOfset" feature [#493](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/493)

## 2016-10-22, Version 1.0.2
- Fix issue in [Consumer Group](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node#consumergroup) where using the migrator with no previous HLC offsets will set initial offsets to -1 [#490](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/490)

## 2016-10-13, Version 1.0.1

## 2016-10-10, Version 1.0.0

Major version change since we're dropping support for Node older than v4.

* Add group membership API protocols 
* Add consumerGroup roundrobin assignment
* Add documentation for ConsumerGroup
* Implemented range assignment strategy
* New consumer group should still emit rebalanced and rebalancing events
* Refactor HLC rebalancing test to run against ConsumerGroup as well
* Add migration from existing HLC offsets in ConsumerGroups
* Implement rolling migration of HLC offsets for consumer groups
* Dropping support for node 0.12 and only supporting 4 and above. Updating to version 1.0.0
* Upgrade mocha
* Migrator: cover the cases of slow rebalances by adding verification by checking check four times make sure the zookeeper ownership did not come back

- Fix for some long standing high-level consumer rebalance issues: [#423](https://github.com/SOHU-Co/kafka-node/pull/423)
	- Fixed issue where consumers who weren't assigned a partition would never rebalance... ever
	- Fixed issue where calling `close` consumer did not force the consumer to leave the consumer group and so locks the partition(s) for (the default) of 30000ms
	- Fixed issue where consumers who weren't assigned a partition never emitted a `rebalance` event after rebalancing
	- Additional cases to be addressed in the next release:
		- If consumer joins or leaves a group during another consumers rebalance then that rebalancing consumer may miss owning partitions
		- Changes to a topic's partition does not trigger a rebalance
